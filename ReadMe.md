Practical Section Questions
1. Implementing Static Array
a. Create a fixed-size array of capacity 7. Use for loop to accept elements into the array and print out the array.
b. Insert the numbers [3] at index 0 using shift-insert and 8
c. Show the array after each insertion. 
d. Delete the element at index 2 using a shift-left deletion. Show the array after deletion. 
e. Implement and run a linear search to find value 6 and return its index or -1 if not found.

2. Capacity tracing (Intermediate)
a. Append integers 0..19 to a Dynamic Array class that doubles capacity when full. After each append, print current length and capacity. Explain why capacity changes occur at particular appends.
b. Create a linked list with the following [4, 13], [34, 2], [1, 11], [23, 24] using dynamic arrays with pointers.
c. Insert [12, 7] at the Head and [90, 37] at the tail. Show resulting linked list.
d. Optimize the code the improve insertion at the tail from O(n) to O(1).
e. Perform deletion of [1, 11], and [90, 37]   after the insertion, show resulting linked list
